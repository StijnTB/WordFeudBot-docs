# Global Project Information
  
## About us

Welcome! We are Stijn Boschloo and Joram Heek, the creators of a WordFeud bot (which you probably know since you have found this site). We first want to give a short introduction to help you better understand our project and its structure.   
We are 2 Dutch high school students from VWO 6 and this bot is our PWS: our 'ProfielWerkStuk', a final project for any student in their last year of secondary education. This means that we had to spend 80 hours on either a research project or a product and make a report about the process and the results. We chose to do our PWS in Computer Science, since we both have an affinity for it. The idea to make a bot for WordFeud came from Joram, who plays it at a high level. We realized that there has not been done that much for this specific subject, or at least not as far as we could see, and decided to try and see how advanced and strategic we could make a bot while steering clear of AI and Machine Learning. Due to this chosen path, any decision the bot makes is fully based on strategies we coded, allowing for a much deeper understanding of those decisions.

## About this website

On this site, we hope to answer most of your questions regarding our project: A bot for the online game WordFeud. We have tried our best to seperate this documentation into multiple categories to reduce the amount of unnecessary information you are required to read, depending on specific interests. We have set up 2 paths, but feel free to scan through and look at the things you like. The first path, *Main Project*, focusses on the PWS side of the project. This contains background information, research and conclusions. If you are interested in the entire process, the *Main Project* track is for you. On the other hand, if you found us through the Github page, the *Additional Project Info* path might be more interesting. This track focusses on code and gives a deep dive if you want to fully understand how the bot makes its decissions.

We hope you will have a great time reading and aspire to inspire you to start a project yourself!

Stijn & Joram
