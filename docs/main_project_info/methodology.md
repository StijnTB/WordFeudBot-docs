# Methodology

Here, we will discuss the process that took place during the project, from the idea all the way to our final product.

## The start

The initial month of the project was over quick. We took some time to map out the idea and flesh it out. We also set up [our main Github repository][github_repo] to make sure we could start efficiently during summer break.

## The development process

We made a good start during summer break, spending around 60 hours to build our own simplified local version of WordFeud to make the integration of the bots easier. During these months, the player side of the game was also developed. The main goal here was to create a solid foundation from which we could expand, so the focus was set on keeping the codebase organised and structured. About the last month was used to create a rudimentary Greedy bot, constructing it from the (pseudo-)code in the [report of Berntsson and Ericsson][report_MB&FE].

When school started again, we used the first few weeks to work out the kinks in this original code base and fix the bugs that turned up. After this, a more precise roadmap was created to give us a better idea of the weekly goals and deadlines.
